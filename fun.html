                <h3 class="float-center"><b>Soccer</b></h3>

                <p>One of my hobbies is that I started to play soccer since I was in elementary school. I wasn't into sports back in elementary
                    school, but when I tried playing soccer for the first time it completely changed my life. At first, I only played soccer with
                    friends during recess. As time went on, I joined a soccer team in one of the local leagues in my area. Since then, I've practiced
                    and enhanced my soccer skills so I could play agaisnt the toughest teams. Playing soccer also helps me to relax when I have stress
                    and frustration. I haven't play soccer ltely, but I hoped to go back to it once I graduate.

                <h3 class="float-center"><b>Anime/Manga</b></h3>

                <p>Another hobby I have is that I enjoy watching anime and reading manga. Anime and manga has become popular in recent years and reaching
                    many audiences worldwide. Anime is referred as an animation that originated from Japan and manga is referred as a style of Japanese comic books
                    originated from Japan. The most ineretesting thing about manga is that you read it from right to left rather than left to right.
                    Anime has great theme songs, different genres, and amazing fighting sequences. A manga I recommend reading is Blue Lock and its anime
                    is coming out this fall.

                <h3 class="float-center"><b>Music</b></h3>

                <p> A recent hobby that I have is making music. I really enjoy listening to music such that I decided to take it a step further and learn
                    about the process of making a song. Making music allows me to be creative and use different style from different songs onto my own. 
                    I've created different type of beats but I haven't release them since I don't know much about mixing and mastering a song yet. An aspiration
                    that I have is to have a possible music producer career where i can work with proffesionla artists and have my music be published in all media
                    platforms.
